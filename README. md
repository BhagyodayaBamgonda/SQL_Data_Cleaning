# SQL Data Cleaning Project

This project demonstrates a complete **data cleaning process using SQL in MySQL Workbench**.
The dataset used contains information on layoffs across various companies, countries, and industries.
The goal was to clean and standardize the raw data for better usability in analysis and reporting.

## Objective

To apply SQL-based data cleaning techniques on a real-world dataset and ensure:
- Removal of duplicates
- Handling of null and empty values
- Standardization of inconsistent formats
- Optimization of data structure

## Key Cleaning Steps

- **Duplicate Removal** using `ROW_NUMBER()` and CTEs
- **Filling missing values** based on other rows
- **Cleaning inconsistent entries** (like "Crypto%" â†’ "Crypto")
- **Converting date strings** to proper SQL `DATE` format

## Tools Used

- MySQL Workbench
- SQL (CTEs, window functions, DML & DDL)

## How to Run

1. Open `Data_cleaning.sql` in MySQL Workbench
2. Make sure the original `layoffs` table is present
3. Run the script to clean and structure the data

## Output

A clean version of the dataset named `layoffs3`, free of duplicates, inconsistencies, and nulls.

This project is based on a tutorial by Alex The Analyst.
